Hello,

First of all, sorry for being late with the repository as I already mentioned in the e-mail I had personal matters to attend to which delayed my work as far as wednesday.
This section is comment on my code:
Improvements could be made in the css file, additional refactoring/cleaning up can be done. Through work/change I think some lines are being unused,
but since I think I'm already late I decided not to do that at this moment.
Navigation searchbar doesn't do any searching(I kept it for the UI), but the Image-Library section filter does as I think in mobile view its a much better option for filtering images.
You can test the sidebar button, sidebar link hovers, grid/list view buttons aswell as the eye icon on each image.
I used the random-user api but I stuck with only the names from it and hardcoded the image for the looks. The api calls are made with axios.
Also, the api call could be an independent function that can be called elsewhere to make it more reusable.

I'm looking forward to explaining my code deeper(mistakes aswell) and to get your thoughts on it.

Best regards,
Ajdin
