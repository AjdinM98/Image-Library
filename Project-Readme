Hello,

First of all, sorry for being late with the repository as I already mentioned in the e-mail I had personal matters to attend to which delayed my work as far as wednesday.
This section is comment on my code:
Navigation searchbar doesn't do any searching(I kept it for the UI), but the Image-Library section filter does as I think in mobile view its a much better option for filtering images.
You can test the sidebar button, sidebar link hovers, grid/list view buttons aswell as the eye icon on each image.
I used the random-user api but I stuck with only the names from it and hardcoded the image for the looks. The api calls are made with axios.
The navigation bar can be done in many different ways which we can discuss.

I'm looking forward to explaining my code deeper(mistakes aswell) and to get your thoughts on it.

Best regards,
Ajdin
